🔹 What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the ability of a computer or machine to do tasks that normally require human intelligence — like thinking, learning, decision-making, or problem-solving.

🧠 Real-Life Example:
Google Maps: It shows the fastest route by analyzing traffic — like how a human would plan it.

Siri or Alexa: You ask a question, and it replies like a human assistant.

🔹 The Impact of AI-Powered Applications
AI is everywhere — and it's changing industries.

💡 Examples of Impact:
Healthcare: AI scans X-rays faster than doctors.

Finance: AI detects fraudulent transactions.
Retail: Amazon recommends products based on your behavior.
Transportation: Self-driving cars use AI to drive safely.

🔹 Rule-Based Systems vs. Machine Learning Systems
✅ Rule-Based Systems:
Work using "if-this-then-that" rules.
You manually write all the logic.

Example:

IF temperature > 38°C THEN show "fever alert"
💡 Like a traffic light that turns red after 60 seconds. Fixed rules, no learning.

🤖 Machine Learning Systems:
Learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.
You give examples, and it figures out the rules.
Example:
You show 10,000 images of cats and dogs, and it learns how to identify them — without writing rules.

🔹 Narrow AI vs. General AI
🤏 Narrow AI (Weak AI):
Performs one task very well but can’t do other things.
This is the AI we use today.
Examples:
Netflix movie recommendations.
Face detection on phones.

🧠 General AI (Strong AI):
Can think, reason, and adapt like a human.
Not built yet. It’s still in research.

Example:
A robot that can cook, drive, teach, and give therapy like a real person. (Sci-fi level!)

🔹 What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning is a subset of AI.
It means teaching a computer to learn from data and improve over time — without being manually coded.

Real-life example:
Spam email detection — You don’t tell the machine all spam rules. It learns from past spam emails.

🔹 What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.

It uses neural networks (inspired by the human brain) to handle complex problems like image or speech recognition.

Example:
Face recognition in Facebook
Voice assistants like Alexa/Siri

🔹 AI vs. ML vs. Deep Learning — Similarities and Differences
| Concept          | Meaning                               | Example                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| AI               | Machines mimicking human intelligence | Self-driving car           |
| Machine Learning | Learning from data                    | Predicting house prices    |
| Deep Learning    | Using brain-like networks to learn    | Detecting tumors in X-rays |

The Relationship Between AI, ML, and Deep Learning
AI is the umbrella concept — making machines smart.
ML is a way to achieve AI — using data to learn.
Deep Learning is a type of ML — for more complex tasks.

| Term          | What It Means                                 | Real-World Example                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| AI            | Machines doing smart things like humans       | Alexa, Google Maps                   |
| ML            | AI that learns from data                      | Netflix recommendations              |
| Deep Learning | ML using neural networks for complex tasks    | Self-driving cars, voice recognition |
| Rule-Based    | Manual logic; no learning                     | Traffic lights, basic alerts         |
| Narrow AI     | AI for specific tasks only                    | Spam filters, face unlock            |
| General AI    | AI with full human-like intelligence (future) | Sci-fi robots                        |
